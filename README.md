# DApp

### This is my first decentralized app! It's a simple contract that allows the user to get/set values. For this DApp I used:
 
- React for the Frontend
- Ethers.js to interact with the Ethereum blockchain
- Solidity to write the contract (in Remix Ethereum IDE) 
- Ganache to create a private Ethereum blockchain to test the DApp.


## How it works

- Should be run in a browser with a MetaMask extension (Chrome, Firefox, MetaMask app on mobile).
- Clicking "Connect Wallet" prompts a MetaMask log in. After connecting, the wallet address will appear on the screen.
- The user will then be able to update the value, which will prompt MetaMask to confirm the gas fee (this contract is connected to a wallet on my local chain, using Ganache).
- Clicking "Get Current Value" will display the updated value to the screen.
