# DApp

### This is my first decentralized app! It's a simple contract that allows the user to get/set values. For this Dapp I used:
 
- React for the Frontend
- Ethers.js to interact with the Ethereum blockchain
- Solidity to write the contract (in Remix Ethereum IDE) 
- Ganache to create a private Ethereum blockchain to test the DApp.


## How to use - https://mayawhaley.github.io/simplestore/

- Should be run in a browser with a MetaMask extension (Chrome, Firefox, MetaMask app on mobile).
- Clicking "Connect Wallet" will prompt a MetaMask log in. After connecting, the wallet address will appear on the screen.
- Then the user will be able to update the value, which will prompt MetaMask to confirm the gas fee (highly recommend using Ganache for test wallets).
- It may take a minute (actually, ~15 seconds) for your updated value to load, as it may still be processing.
- Click "Get Current Value" to have your updated value appear on the screen.
